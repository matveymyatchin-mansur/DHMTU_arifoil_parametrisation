# DHMTU arifoil parametrisation
A prospect study aiming to reverse-engineer the DHMTU airfoil to be able to freely use and parametrise the geometry for scientific and engineering studies into ground effect vehicles.

The idea is to mathematically dissect the DHMTU profile using publicly available literature and provide prospect researchers, students, and even enthusiasts with a tool to get the geometric data on this airfoil family. By doing so, there will hopefully be more interest and attention in this airfoil family, allowing researchers much more freedom when conducting studies into the ground effect.

This project is expected to take off upon completion (or shortly after) of the [GEV-project](https://github.com/matveymyatchin-mansur/GEV-project.git), conducted by the same author. This was done to ensure sufficient background in aerodynamics and the related mathematics beforehand.
